              <p>Hello friends, 
              welcome to my final project for CS50X. 
              I tried to make an album of things that were 
              interesting to me personally in this course and I wanted to share my experiences with you.

              <p>Well, in session 0, I came across lamps. I was interested in how you can simulate anything from the real world with lamps. Even emojis,
              even the word hello.

              <p>Professor David Malan is one of the strangest people I have ever met, 
                a person with energy and passion who can talk for hours about computer science, 
                sweaty and very funny.

                CS50 cat, I searched many places, 
                I really want to know why this cat is there, to be honest,
                I didn't find any good information.

                Get to know one of the most important creatures of the course.
                 I'll introduce you to the plastic duck! Well, let's be honest, 
                 if it wasn't for this artificial intelligence duck, 
                 I don't think I would have been able to finish the course, thank you very much.

                In the end, I want to thank the Iran cs50 team for their 
                hard work to make the course in Iran well. 
                I wish them success from the bottom of my heart.
